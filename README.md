Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on fuel efficiency involves delving into datasets related to vehicle characteristics and their corresponding fuel consumption. One crucial aspect of EDA is correlation analysis, which entails examining the relationships between different variables to understand how they influence fuel efficiency. Variables such as engine size, vehicle weight, transmission type, and fuel type can all impact a vehicle's fuel efficiency. By conducting correlation analysis, we can identify which factors have the most significant influence on fuel efficiency. Visualization plays a vital role in EDA, as it allows us to visually represent the relationships between variables through scatter plots, heatmaps, and other graphical techniques. These visualizations provide insights into trends, patterns, and outliers within the data, aiding in the identification of key factors affecting fuel efficiency. Moreover, visualization techniques such as box plots and histograms can help in understanding the distribution of fuel efficiency across different categories of vehicles, such as by make, model, or year. Overall, through correlation analysis and visualization, EDA enables us to gain valuable insights into the factors driving fuel efficiency and inform decision-making processes aimed at improving vehicle performance and environmental sustainability.
